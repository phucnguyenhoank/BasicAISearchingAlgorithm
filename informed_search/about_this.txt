This type of algorithm use an function named f(n) to evaluate 'the goodness' of nodes are gonna be expanded
f(n) use the information of the Problem to evaluate,
depends on each particular algorithm f(n) will have each particular way to evaluate the goodness.

Heuristic function h(n) is a function which evaluates the cost to get to the goal of a node
h(n) >= 0, h(n) = 0 when n = goal.
